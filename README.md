## Compilation

_Just gonna pretend somebody will ever need this shiet..._

Currently, build should fail and program will be completely unusable (even if you manage to launch it).

Either way, to build a project, just clone it somewhere and `make` it. But have in mind that it was developed on macOS and compiled using __clang__, so probably, it won't compile via __gcc__ on Linux.
